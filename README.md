This is my version of the blog app we built in Udacity's Web Development course (https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253).

For learning purposes, Steve Huffman, instructor and founding engineer of Reddit, keps all the Python code in one module. So ... it's pretty sloppy. Especially when I went to town on it after class finished.

Anyways, most of the css is mine (well, my research from inspecting websites I liked) and the beer adaptation of the blog idea is mine.

The original app created in class, aka the 'stock version', whose code was all homework assignments, can be found at the following links.

The Ascii Art channel on my page was an 'in-class' assignment. I simply integrated it into my beer blog.
